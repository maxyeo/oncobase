# oncobase

Created by Max Yeo and Alwin Hui for Databases Final Project 600.315/415.

Oncobase is a database of cancer statistics through the years 1975-2012 segmented by cancer type, racial subgroups, age, sex. It uses data collected from the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and organizes them in a more accessible format for users to collect and gather data, allowing the data to not only be available, but also accessible to the general public.
